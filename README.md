## Introduction <a name="installation"></a>
WeRateDogs is a Twiiter account, that let people to rate dogs with a funny comment. The account was started at 2015 by student Matt Nelson and nowadays (21.12.2021) has 9,1 Million followers and 14,8K tweets. But why it is so popular? One of the reasons is that the numerators are often greater than 10 (11/10,12/10, 14/10 as in the screenschotâ€¦) Here is an example from https://twitter.com/dog_rates.

WeRateDogs Project consist from:

1 .Data Wrangling includes 3 main parts:

     1. Gathering Data
     2. Accessing Data
     3. Cleaning Data
Analysing and Visualising Data
Reporting

### Summary <a name="summary"></a>
In this project, we wrangle and analyze dogs data set from Twitter.

A complete assessment and cleaning of the entire dataset would require extraordinary effort, so it was necessary to assess only part of its problems and clean up the data obtained from 3 sources:

1. Tweet archive of Twitter from @dog_rates, WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates the dogs of people with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. What about the numerators? Almost always more than 10.11 / 10, etc.

2. Tweet Image Predictions File Every image in the Twitter WeRateDogs archive has been processed by a neural network that can classify dog breeds. Results: A table full of the top three image predictions, plus each tweet ID, image URL, and image numbe

3. Data through the Twitter API Since we have the tweet IDs from the WeRateDogs Twitter archive, we will be able to collect the number of retweets, the number of favorites, and any additional data you find interesting for all available tweets. The Twitter API requires users to be authorized to use it. This means that you need to create your own Twitter developer account before you can run your API request code.
